        <p>
            My name is <b>Miriam Asadu.</b>   
            <i>Technology</i> which is the hands on application of scientific knowledge to help solve the varied problems of man in itself a bundle of
            joy.
            Personally, I have come to really cherish all the beautiful things crafted out from scientific laws, principles,
            and theories. The ease and convenience it brings on spices the everyday life.
            Narrowing it down to the world of <i>Information Technology</i>, I can't but marvel at the complexity yet simplicity at which datum is
            manipulated and used in the<i>IT</i> world.<i>Technology</i> is a bundle of joy no doubt, I love the ease it has brought to life.
            To hop in and out of cars and bikes are just treasures, thanks goodness no one has to trekk endlessly for
            hours to get to a place.

        <h4 class="subtitle"> <i>knowledge Acquired And The Importance Of CSS</i></h4>
        <p>
            It has been quite an interesting journey here at <b>Stutern</b>. I have learnt the version control system (git)to learning
            the structural language of the web (HTML), there has not been a dull moment.
            The <b>cascading style sheets(CSS)</b> however has also added a sort of beauty to the hitherto boring pages we initially only created with Html.
            I have learnt a couple of <b>CSS</b> properties like the color,text transform etc and the box model which is foundational to an in depth 
            understanding of the subject.
            The importance of CSS cannot be overemphasized as it used in page layout and formatting. It also makes for a better user 
            experience as it brings to the web page a sort of asetheticity that html cannot afford.

        <h4 class="subtitle"> <i>Diffrentiating Padding, Border And Margin</i></h4>
        <p>
            The css box model consists of the padding, border, margin and content. The focus however is on the first three.
            The padding is the space between the content and the border. The border on the other hand shelters or covers the 
            content and the padding. The margin is the outermost part,it is how much space around an object. 
             Padding is how much space is within an object sides and its contents.  Border is between the margin and padding.
